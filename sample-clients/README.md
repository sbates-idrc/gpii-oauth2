This directory contains 2 sample OAuth 2.0 client web applications:

- `gpii-oauth2-sample-client` - a sample client built without any OAuth 2.0 client library
- `gpii-oauth2-sample-client-passport` - a sample client built using Passport's OAuth 2.0 support

These clients are not production ready. They have been built for illustration and to exercise the GPII OAuth 2.0 server implementation.
